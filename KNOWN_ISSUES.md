# Known Issues

Deferred, non-blocking issues found during Phase 2/3 validation. Logged here instead of fixed
immediately so they aren't rediscovered from scratch later. Each entry: what, where, why deferred,
suggested fix.

## Calibration gate: markdown bold markers can break verbatim-quote matching

**Where**: `schemelogic/deferral/calibration_gate.py`, `_quote_is_verbatim()`.

**What**: Source documents in `data/raw_documents/*.md` use markdown `**bold**` around key phrases
(e.g. AB-PMJAY.md's `**Senior citizens 70 years and above (added 11 September 2024)**: the scheme
was expanded...`). A judge quote that spans across a `**` boundary (quoting the prose without the
markdown syntax, as it naturally would) fails the verbatim substring check, since `_normalize()`
doesn't strip markdown syntax — the `**` characters sit in the source but not in the quote.

**Found**: AB-PMJAY Phase 3 check-in (2026-08-18). A judge `temporal_supersession` finding's quote
tripped `quote_verbatim_in_source: False` partly due to this, though the gate still correctly
deferred the finding for other reasons (fabricated boolean `retired_value`, not reproduced on
independent re-sample) — so this hasn't caused a wrong decision yet, just a partially-wrong reason
in the audit trail.

**Why deferred**: Didn't change any gate decision observed so far. Fixing it well requires
deciding how much markdown to strip from `_normalize()` without also loosening the check enough to
let genuinely fabricated quotes slip through (e.g. don't want to strip so aggressively that
`_quote_is_verbatim` starts ignoring real textual differences).

**Suggested fix**: Strip common markdown emphasis syntax (`**`, `*`, `_`, `` ` ``) from both the
quote and the document in `_normalize()` before substring matching. Add a regression test using a
document with the same `**bold**`-spanning-a-quote-boundary shape as AB-PMJAY.md's 70+ clause.

**Status**: Open, unfixed as of 2026-08-18.
